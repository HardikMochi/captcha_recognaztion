Captcha is computer generating text images used to distinguish interactions given by humans or machines. Normally, a captcha image consists of a fixed number of characters (e.g. digit, letter). These characters are not only distorted, scaled into multiple different sizes but also can be overlapped and crossed by multiple random lines.
<br>I build deep learning models solving this captcha recognition .model consists of convolutional layers to learn visual features. These features are then fed to GRU to compute the final captcha prediction.

## Executive Summary


<a name="Dataset Description"></a>
### Dataset Description :
<details open>
<summary>Show/Hide</summary>
<br>

The dataset used for this project consists of 1070 .png images of text based CAPTCHA. The dataset has been taken from https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248380891_CAPTCHA_dataset. Each dataset image is of 5 character set and the character set is defined as all English small letters and digits from 0 to 9. Hence a total of 36 characters are present in the character set.
<br>The CAPTCHA images consist of noise in the form of lines and blurriness. The characters in images are also not straight and clear.

### Data Preprocessing
<details open>
<summary>Show/Hide</summary>
<br>
    The images in the dataset have a filename same as the CAPTCHA present in the image.The images are first pre-processed by reading image and  Each  image is then scaled and reshaped to the size: height- 50, width-300 and the number of channels as 3.
   than we normlize the image and we transfrom it to Pytorch tensor.

### Model Development:
<details open>
<summary>Show/Hide</summary>
<br>

The model developed for this CAPTCHA dataset uses Convolutional Neural Network and GRU. It comprising the input layer, convolutional layers, max pooling layers, dense layers, flatten layers dropout layers and GRU layers. 
<br>Thus, the model uses an image of dimension (3,75, 300) as input and gets output  having dimension 20.

</p>
The dataset consists of 1070 sample images out of which 970 images have been used for training and the remaining images for testing purpose. Further, for training the model, a validation split of 0.1 is used which splits the training set such that 90% of the training data is used for training and the remaining 10% for testing. The batch size used is 8
and the number of epochs used is 70.

### Results

<summary>Show/Hide</summary>
<br>

After training the above model for 70 epochs, the following graph was obtained for loss with respect to the number of epochs as shown in figure. We see that as the number of epochâ€™s increases, the loss decreases exponentially. The loss obtained on training set is 0.0388 while the loss on test set is 0.114.

I tested the neural network model using the test data and achieved an accuracy of <strong>0.5710</strong> which is better than the stacking model accuracy of <strong>0.5077</strong>, by <strong>over 5%</strong>. 
    
I wanted to look at the confusion matrix, as this gives a better idea of how the model is performing over all 5 classes.

</p>
    
The error is more contained within adjacent scores with the neural network model. Almost zero confusion between extreme scores 1 and 5, and minimal confusion with scores 2 and 4. Although a score of 3 can be harder to predict, there is definitely an improvement from the Stacking model. Around 97% of the time the model predicts at least the adjacent score to the actual score.

#### Deployment and Application
    
After seeing the improvements from the Stacking model, I was more confident about deploying the model for actionable use.
    
I planned on future improvements being the addition of the neural network model and then creating an application for the model, so as a next step I decided to make a working application to test out new reviews using streamlit. I have deployed the app using Heroku: https://hilton-hotel-app.herokuapp.com/. 
    
Using this model, we will learn more about our new and old customers, then we can improve Hilton Hotel's guest satisfaction, and as a result increase customer retention and bring in new travelers.
    
#### Future Development
    
* Create a webscraper spider for twitter, reddit, etc for further model assessment
